\textbf{The Japanese Language - Nihongo} series has two volumes with the aim of
teaching the two Japanese syllabic scripts: Volume \jvolumes{①}
\textbf{hiragana} and volume \jvolumes{②} \textbf{katakana}.%.

\jhiraganaonly{

This book is the \textbf{first} volume \jvolumes{①} of \textit{The Japanese
Language - Nihongo series}, which can be used to learn the Japanese script
called \textbf{hiragana}.

}
%
\jkatakanaonly{

This book is the \textbf{second} volume \jvolumes{②} of \textit{The Japanese
Language - Nihongo} series, which can be used to learn the Japanese script
called \textbf{katakana}.

}

While there is no specific reason to start with \jtopic or \jtopicopposite when
learning the first Japanese script, historically \textbf{hiragana} is the first
choice. This may be because hiragana is more common in Japanese texts than
katakana, and also because hiragana is used to transcribe Japanese Chinese
characters (kanji), such as station names. However, since a beginner in
Japanese has almost no vocabulary, the usability of hiragana is overestimated
by native Japanese. In fact, an English-speaking foreigner might consider
learning katakana first, because foreign words in Japanese are written in
katakana, and after mastering katakana, such a learner would be able to read
and write thousands of words with a little imagination, compared to almost none
in the case of hiragana. \jhiraganaonly{This book assumes that you are learning
\textbf{hiragana} as either your first or second script.} \jkatakanaonly{This
book assumes that you have learned \textbf{katakana} as your first or second
script.}

Whichever script you start with, it is recommended that you finish the first
script before learning the second. It is also recommended to finish hiragana
\textbf{and} katakana before learning Japanese Chinese characters (kanji).

Common chapters are repeated or slightly modified in each volume, so a learner
can choose to start with volume {\jvolumes{①}} or {\jvolumes{②}} and get all
the references in each volume. Skip the parts you already know.
