While there is no specific reason to start with \textbf{hiragana} when it comes
to learn the first Japanese writing script, historically \textbf{hiragana} is
the first choice. It might be the assumption that \textbf{hiragana} are more
common in Japanese texts than \textbf{katakana} and also when Japanese Chinese
characters (kanji) are transcribed (for example as station names)
\textbf{hiragana} is used. However, since a beginner in learning Japanese also
have almost no vocabulary knowledge, the usability is overestimated by Japanese
native people. Actually, a foreigner from an English speaking background might
consider to learn \textbf{katakana} first, because foreign words in Japanese
are written in \textbf{katakana} and after mastering the \textbf{katakana} such
learner would be able to read and write thousands of words with a little
imagination, compared to almost none in case of \textbf{hiragana}.

With whatever script to start with, it is recommended to finish this first
script and then learn the second script. It is also recommended to finish
\textbf{hiragana} and \textbf{katakana} before learning Japanese Chinese
characters (kanji).

Common chapters are repeated or are slightly modified in each volume, so that a
learner can choose to start with volume ①  or ②  and obtain all the references
in each volume. Skip the passages you already know.
