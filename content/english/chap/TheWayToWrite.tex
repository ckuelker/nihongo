This chapter explains how to read and write \jkanavoc. After introducing the
sound structure, the traditional way to display and order \jtopic is
presented. A short part lists functions of \jtopic, what \jtopic
is used for. The following section introduces very briefly the pronounciation.
As this book focus' on writing the major part of the sections teaches
about how to write \jtopic and inform about special \jtopic as well as general
punctuation. The last part is about seldomly used \jtopic.


\jscript{} derived from \textbf{Chinese} characters, called
\hyperref[sec:Kanji]{kanji}. All \jtopic{} together form a complete phonetic
script with less than 50 letters (or morae). With this script all Japanese
words can be written.

\ifor{gojūonzu}{五十音図}{ごじゅうおんず}{50@50 Laute Tafel}

The collection of \textbf{\jtopic} is usually displayed in the
\hyperref[sec:Gojuonzu]{gojūonzu} (lit. table of fifty sounds), a grid of 10x5
fields in which the characters are displayed. Even though nominally the
\hyperref[sec:Gojuonzu]{gojūonzu} is containing 50 characters the grid is not
completely occupied. Additionally there is also one character added to the end.
So with five columns and one extra letter, the current number of
\textbf{\jtopic} is 46. %
\ifthenelse{\equal{hiragana}{\jtopic}}{
The script has no character for doubling a vowel (which would not be displayed
in the \hyperref[sec:Gojuonzu]{gojūonzu}) anyways. Unlike \textbf{katakaka}
with 47, \textbf{hiragana} has 46 distinct characters, still below 50.

\ifthenelse{\equal{katakana}{\jtopic}}{
If we would count also the character for doubling a vowel (which is sadly not
displayed in the \hyperref[sec:Gojuonzu]{gojūonzu}). Unlike \textbf{hiragana}
with 46, \textbf{katakana} has 47 distinct characters, still below 50.

This document is structured according to the \hyperref[sec:Gojuonzu]{gojūonzu},
five \textbf{\jtopic} will be introduced in one section to be learned together.

Even though \textbf{\jtopic} can be used by its own to express the complete
content of the Japanese language it is seldom used as such. Using all Japanese
scripts \textbf{hiragana}, \textbf{katakana} and \hyperref[sec:Kanji]{kanji}
has the advantage to see word borders easily and render the
\hyperref[sec:SpaceCharacter]{space character} obsolete. So a Japanese
\textbf{\jtopic} sentence with \textbf{\jtopic} only and without a
\hyperref[sec:SpaceCharacter]{space character} is hardly understandable,
because it is impossible to distinguish words. However even if the
\hyperref[sec:SpaceCharacter]{space character} would be introduced as in Roman
languages, Japanese has so many \hyperref[sec:Homophone]{homophones} that it
would be still very difficult to impossible to understand sentences.
Esspeccially \hyperref[sec:Kanji]{kanji} give context and meaning. Therefore
the booundaries of script types (\hyperref[sec:Hiragana]{hiragana},
\hyperref[sec:Katakana]{katakana} and \hyperref[sec:Kanji]{kanji}) are
the most significant indicator for word boundaries.

\phantomsection
\label{sec:role}

In the Japanese written language each script has a role. The role of
\textbf{\jtopic} changed over the time. The last big change was after the end
of World War II and \textbf{\jtopic} got the roles it still has up to date and
they are fixed for the time being.

Therefore in commercials, \hyperref[sec:Manga]{manga} and literature describing
foreign concepts \textbf{katakana} has a over proportional usage.
