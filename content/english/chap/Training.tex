Every person is learning in a different way. What works well for one does not
need to work well also for the other. Because of this an ultimate recipe to
learn \textbf{\jtopic} can not be given here. However the introduction to this
chapter would like to try to give some  hints gathered from learning and
teaching experience.

\begin{description}

\item[Not too less:] If one learns one character per day, it will take for
        \textbf{\jtopic} roughly \jkanacount{} days. If you restrict this to
        working days it will take approximately two month. If you restrict it
        to a 2h lesson per week it will take a year to learn \textbf{\jtopic}.
        It is obvious that one is likely to forget the first characters when
        learning the last. However, even with this method it is not impossible
        but not likely.

\item[Not too much:]  To learn \textbf{\jtopic} in one day is unlikely
        possible. At least parts will be forgotten the next day.

\end{description}

From the practice the best results have been seen when learners have tried to
learn \textbf{\jtopic} in one to three weeks. The suggestion is to learn one
line (five characters) per day in a cumulative way. Means, repeat every day the
already learned characters and that up to 10 days until all are learned. And
then repeat this exercise until they hardly can not be forgotten any more. So
for at least 14 consecutive days without break.

\begin{description}

\item[Develop your own style:] Learning one character at a time or a row (five
        characters at a time) or learn the whole table of \textbf{\jtopic} is
        possible. With some method it can take 3 weeks or with an other method
        1 week. That does not matter. What do matter is that oneself is
        comfortable with the method and that oneself extract fun out of it,
        even when forced to learn \textbf{\jtopic}. Decide by yourself how
        often you repeat. But decide. And write down your decision. Maybe even
        plan it in your daily plan. A good practice is to learn
        \textbf{\jtopic} 20 times a day for five minutes rather then one time
        for three hours a day or one time a week for 10 hours.

\item[Search for aid:] Aid can come in may manifestations. Of course it is
        useful to ask a Japanese to help. But there are many other ways for
        helping yourself.  One example are flashcards. Of course it is easy to
        print them in this book. However as said before: find your own way. And
        if you create flashcards by yourself you already learn the content up
        to a certain level.

\item[Use Squares:] Some European languages uses lines to teach letters. In
        Japanese you should use a square and draw the letter in the middle. If
        uncertain about the shape and orientation of the character use a square
        and look at the squares filled with \textbf{\jtopic} in this section to
        understand the alignment and orientation.

\end{description}

Here are some examples for flashcards. But feel free to invent your own.

        \caption{Flashcard type 1 (rōmaji - kana) }
        \label{fig:FlashCardTypeOne}
\end{figure}

Or to learn both:

\begin{figure}[H]
        \input{\jpparal/FlashCardRomajiBoth}
        \caption{Flashcard type 2 (rōmaji - 2 kana)}
        \label{fig:FlashCardTypeTwo}
\end{figure}

\normalsize

To dive deep into Japanese of course skipping rōmaji is the preferred method:

\begin{figure}[H]
        \input{\jpparal/FlashCardKana}
        \caption{Flashcard type 3 (katakana - hiragana)}
        \label{fig:FlashCardTypeThree}
\end{figure}

This training chapter can be used as an additional aid to learn
\textbf{\jtopic}. And also here it is important to develop ones own method.
However some hints on learning with this training chapter can be given.

\begin{description}

\item[Reading Loud:] While writing a \textbf{\jtopic} character in this book
        (and probably also later), read out loud the sound of the character.
        Always.

\item[Invent your own cribs:] One can (maybe should?) invent one crib per
        character by oneself. Especially if the characters is difficult to
        remember. It might be useful to write it down on the self created
        flashcard for that specific character.

\item[Regular Repetition:] It is of course possible to fill out all fields for
        one character in a very short time. The learning effect should be
        minimal though. Better is to fill out one row and then the second row
        an hour later, the third row the next day and so own. Oneself has to
        decide the rhythm of the repetition.

\item[Transcription:]  Search for a  \textbf{\jtopic} text and read it. Write
        for every \jtopic word the Roman letters. If this is possible without
        looking up the \jtopic, then the transcription should be reversed. Find
        some Japanese text written in Rōmaji and transcribe them to \jtopic on
        a different piece of paper.
