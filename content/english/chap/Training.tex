Everyone learns in a different way. What works for one person may not work for
another. For this reason, an ultimate recipe for learning \textbf{\jtopic}
cannot be given here. However, the introduction to this chapter will try to
give some hints, gathered from learning and teaching experience.

\begin{description}

\item[Not too less:] If you learn one character per day, it will take about
        \jkanacount{} days for \textbf{\jtopic}. If you limit this to working
        days, it will take about two months. If you limit it to 2 hours per
        week, it will take a year to learn \textbf{\jtopic}. It is obvious
        that you are likely to forget the first characters while learning the
        last ones. But even with this method, it is not impossible, just
        unlikely.

\item[Not too much:] Learning \textbf{\jtopic} in one day is probably not
        possible. At least parts will be forgotten the next day.

\end{description}

In practice, the best results have been seen when students have tried to learn
\textbf{\jtopic} in one to three weeks. The suggestion is to learn one line
(five characters) per day in a cumulative way. That is, repeat the already
learned characters every day for up to 10 days until they are all learned. And
then repeat this exercise until they are almost impossible to forget. So for at
least 14 consecutive days without a break.

\begin{description}

\item[Develop your own style:] It is possible to learn one character at a time
        or one line (five characters at a time) or the whole table of
        \textbf{\jtopic}. It may take 3 weeks with one method or 1 week with
        another. It does not matter. What matters is that you feel comfortable
        with the method and that you have fun with it, even if you are forced
        to learn \textbf{\jtopic}. Decide for yourself how often to repeat. But
        decide. And write it down. Maybe even include it in your daily
        schedule. A good practice is to learn \textbf{\jtopic} 20 times a day
        for five minutes rather than once for three hours a day or once a week
        for 11 hours.

\item[Search for help:] Help can come in many forms. Of course, asking a
        Japanese person for help is useful. But there are many other ways to
        help yourself. One example is flash cards. Of course, it is easy to
        print them out in this book. But as I said before, find your own way.
        And if you make your own flashcards, you have already learned the
        content to a certain level.

\item[Use squares:] Some European languages use lines to teach letters. In
        Japanese, you should use a square and draw the letter in the middle. If
        you are unsure about the shape and orientation of the character, use a
        square and look at the squares filled with \textbf{\jtopic} in this
        section to understand the alignment and orientation.

\end{description}

Here are some examples of flashcards. But feel free to design your own.

\begin{figure}[H]
        \input{\jpparal/FlashCardRomajiKana}
        \caption{Flashcard type 1 (rōmaji - kana) }
        \label{fig:FlashCardTypeOne}
\end{figure}

Or to learn both:

\begin{figure}[H]
        \input{\jpparal/FlashCardRomajiBoth}
        \caption{Flashcard type 2 (rōmaji - 2 kana)}
        \label{fig:FlashCardTypeTwo}
\end{figure}

\normalsize

Of course, skipping rōmaji is the preferred method to dive deep into Japanese:

\begin{figure}[H]
        \input{\jpparal/FlashCardKana}
        \caption{Flashcard type 3 (katakana - hiragana)}
        \label{fig:FlashCardTypeThree}
\end{figure}

This training chapter can be used as an additional tool to learn
\textbf{\jtopic}. Again, it is important to develop your own method. However,
some hints for learning can be given with this training chapter.

\begin{description}

\item[Reading Loud:] When you write a \textbf{\jtopic} character in this book
        (and probably later), read the sound of the character out loud. Always.

\item[Invent your own cribs:] You can (maybe should?) invent one crib per
        character yourself. Especially if the character is hard to remember. It
        might be useful to write it down on the self-created flashcard for that
        specific character.

\item[Regular Repetition:] It is of course possible to fill in all fields for a
        character in a very short time. However, the learning effect should be
        minimal. It is better to fill in one row, then the second row an hour
        later, the third row the next day, and so on. The rhythm of repetition
        is up to you.

\item[Transcription:] Find a \textbf{\jtopic} text and read it. Write the Roman
        characters for each \jtopic{} word. If this is possible without looking
        up the \jtopic, then the transcription should be reversed. Find some
        Japanese text written in Rōmaji and transcribe it to \jtopic{} on 
        another piece of paper.
