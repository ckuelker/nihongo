The initial versions \texttt{v0.1-v0.8} of this book have been written between
2000 and ⁠2006 by \textbf{Christian Külker} with the title
\textbf{日本語を書こう！} (German: \textit{Lasst uns Japanisch schreiben!}) and
have been released under the “GNU-FDL version 1.2 or any later version
published by the Free Software Foundation with the invariant \textit{Back Cover
Text} section”.  It was developed as reference and training book for the
language course at the VHS Halle (Ravensberg) in Germany starting in the year
2000.\medskip

In 2013 Christian Külker changed the title to \textbf{日本語の書き方：片仮名}
in Japanese and \textbf{The Japanese Script: Katakana} in English and
translated also the content to English as well. He modified the content towards
a self study approach that was released as \texttt{v0.9} to the public under
the same license as PDF under \url{http://christian.kuelker.info} as well as in
source under \url{https://github.com/ckuelker/nihongo}\medskip

The versions \texttt{v1.0-v1.2} updated the content and changed the build
system as well as some graphics to compile under Debian 10 Buster. Some fonts
have been changed.\medskip

Beginning in 2022 the build system was migrated to Debian 11 Bullseye and
merged with additional parts of the Hiragana book v1.2 from 2014
\textbf{日本語の書き方：ひらがな} (German: Die japanische Schrift). The result
translated to English was released in 2022 as \texttt{v1.2}. The release
dropped the invariant section and replaced it with this section \textit{A Short
History}. Consequently the license changed to “GNU-FDL version 1.2 or any later
version published by the Free Software Foundation with \textbf{no} invariant
section”. The URL changed to \url{https://christian.kuelker.info/nihongo/}
