At roughly the same time as \hyperref[sec:Hiragana]{hiragana}, also
\ivoc{katakana}{片仮名}{かたかな}{Katakana} letters were invented by
simplifying the same Chinese characters used for pronunciation. However the
look and feel of \textbf{katakana} is more 'square' not so 'rounded' as
\hyperref[sec:Hiragana]{hiragana}.

\textbf{Katakana} is used today for writing words of foreign origin and for
emphasizing (in commercials or \hyperref[sec:Manga]{manga}) as well as words in
the fauna or flora.
