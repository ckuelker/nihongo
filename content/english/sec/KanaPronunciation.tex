The \textbf{pronunciation} of \hyperref[sec:Hiragana]{hiragana} is the same as
for \hyperref[sec:Katakana]{katakana}. Therefore every
\hyperref[sec:Syllable]{syllable}, more precise every \hyperref[sec:Mora]{mora}
corresponds to a \hyperref[sec:\jscript]{\jtopic} character and is constructed
as 'consonant' + 'vowel' with the exception of |n|. This system of letter for
each \hyperref[sec:Mora]{mora} makes \textbf{pronunciation} absolutely clear
with no ambiguities. However the simplicity of \hyperref[sec:\jscript]{\jtopic}
does not mean that \textbf{pronunciation} in Japanese is simple for English
speakers as it is for Germans. The rigid structure of the fixed
\hyperref[sec:Mora]{mora} sound in Japanese creates the challenge of learning
the proper intonation and duration of Japanese \textbf{pronunciation}.

Almost each Japanese word can be chunked into \hyperref[sec:Mora]{morae} of
high and low pitch witch is a crucial aspect of the spoken language. Compared
to Chinese, Japanese luckily have only two pitches: hi and low. Sometimes this
difference can be even important for the lexis. Homophones can have for example
a difference in pitch which make them distinguishable.  The intonation of high
and low pitches is a crucial aspect of the spoken language. One of the biggest
problems for obtaining a natural sounding \textbf{pronunciation} is the
incorrect intonation. Many European or American learners speak without paying
attention to the correct pitch. That makes the speech sound non-natural for
Japanese. In some language course try to let the learner memorize the natural
pitch of a word or even teach rules for memorization. While there is clearly a
possibility for linguistic rules, they are hard to remember and master.  It is
still possible to learn the correct intonation by resorting to language
learning techniques used by infants or small children: mimicking native
Japanese speakers. Therefore it is highly advised to expose oneself to as many
Japanese spoken language as possible and to mimic it. Radio, podcasts, drama
and television to name a few. However, it is not advised to listen too much
artificial sources like anime or commercials.

The \textbf{pronunciation} of \hyperref[sec:Katakana]{katakana} is exactly the
same as for \hyperref[sec:\jscript]{\jtopic} and most sounds are very close to
the Latin \textbf{pronunciation} but in general are \textbf{pronounced} a
little shorter without any stress. Only the /ra/ sounds, like in /ra/, /ri/,
/ru/, /re/ and /ro/ have no similarity in European languages.
