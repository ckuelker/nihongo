At the beginning of the Heian period (794-1185/1192) the capital was moved to
Kyoto and the relation to China declined. It was also in this time when
manyogana use increased and katakana shaped from kanji components used for
pronunciation. From certain manyogana, that were well known, components where
dropped and the remaining part became katakana. For example from the Chinese
character \jquotesingleja{加}, meaning \jquotesingle{to add} which is
pronounced \jtl{ka} the \jquotesingleja{口} component was dropped and the
remaining \jtl{カ} became the katakana character that is pronounced \jtl{ka}.
