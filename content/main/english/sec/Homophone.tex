The linguistic term \textit{homophone} referenced the fact that some words in
language are pronounced equal but posses a different meaning. The spelling of
\textit{homophone}s may be equal or different.

\begin{center}\begin{tabular}{lllll}
\textbf{Language}&\textbf{word 1}&\textbf{meaning 1}&\textbf{word 2}&\textbf{meaning 2}\\\hline
German (same writing)      &Fliege&the insect  &Fliege &the bow tie \\
German (different writing) &aß    &ate (to eat)&Aas    &carrion     \\
English (same writing)     &does  &to do       &does   &plural of doe\\
English (different writing)&eight &8           &ate    &to eat       \\
\end{tabular}\end{center}

In general the meaning of \textit{homophone}s can be deducted from the context.
The is especially true if the spelling is different and if the
\textit{homophone} occurs while reading. It is more difficult but generally in
most cases possible to deduct the meaning also in spoken language. 

Homophones are rare in European languages like English or German. In Japanese
\textit{homophone}s are extraordinarily often. One reason\footnote{except the
one that people accept it and may even like it do nothing to reduce them} is
the mass import of Chinese words centuries ago by 'neglecting' the
pronunciation. While some Chinese word can be distinguished by pitch, they
become true \textit{homophone}s by flattening all pitches to only two. 

To give an extreme case, the following 22 \hyperref[sec:Kanji]{Kanji} words
(two \hyperref[sec:Kanji]{Kanji} each) are all pronounced /kikō/.

\begin{center}
{機構} {紀行} {稀覯} {騎行} {貴校} {奇功} {貴公} {起稿} {奇行} {機巧} {寄港}\\
{帰校} {気功} {寄稿} {機甲} {帰航} {奇効} {季候} {気孔} {起工} {気候} {帰港}
\end{center}

Even though they sound the same, in written language they can be differentiated. 

% TODO: what if the meaning is equal? Are they still homophones?
