The word \lhentaigana{} is pronounced /hen・tai・gana/ and refers historically
to \hyperref[sec:Kana]{kana} that are used seldom today. They were used until
before 1900 and declared as obsolete\footnote{The word /hentai/ means just
variant.} in the 1900 language reform. Rather than an addition to
\hyperref[sec:Kana]{kana}, \textbf{hentaigana} representing alternative forms to
existing \hyperref[sec:Kana]{kana}. The usage were not formalized and every
writer decides which set to use. It was even common to use two or more
different \textbf{hentaigana} (and standard \hyperref[sec:Kana]{kana}) with the same
pronunciation in the same document by the same author.

Until 1947 \textbf{hentaigana} were used for names. In contemporary Japan the usage
of \textbf{hentaigana} is reduced to traditional decorative elements on shop signs
for example. A few marginal uses remain such as: the word /otemoto/ is written
in \textbf{hentaigana} on some chopsticks or the names in the Japanese family
registry (\lkoseki{}).

Due to Japanese proposals from 2015

(The past, present, and future of \textbf{hentaigana}: Standardization for
information processing) by TAKADA Tomokazu (高田智和) et al. and
\href{https://www.unicode.org/L2/L2015/15318-hentaigana.pdf}{About the
inclusion of standardized codepoints for Hentaigana by YADA Tsutomu (矢田勉)}
}, in 2017 \textbf{hentaigana} became available in Unicode (version 10).
However the usage on computers in 2020, 2021 and 2022 is still difficult. Until
Japanese computer text input methods (like \texttt{Mozc}, \texttt{Anthy}, ...)
support \textbf{hentaigana}, entering this characters on a computer is quite
cumbersome. In \texttt{vim} for example: enter insert mode, press
\texttt{<CTRL+V>+U} and then the hexadecimal UCS number. Of course to actually
see the character a correct font has to be installed. For instance the
font\footnote{See 
\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:Multilingual_support\#Hentaigana}{Wikipedia Help}
for more fonts or the Wikipedia page on
\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hentaigana}{Hentaigana} } \texttt{HanaMinA
Regular} (Hanazono Mincho) can be used to display \textbf{hentaigana}. Be aware that
different fonts with different degree of support are used in one desktop
session. The font used to display this PDF can be different from the font to
display the operating system desktop windows which again can be different from
the font used in the terminal. No font is known to support all characters.
