% シ
% ツ

The Katakana characters {「シ」} and {「ツ」} are difficult to distinguish.
Both are made out of 3 strokes and even the length are equal. In a sentence of

to write properly and distinguish?

\CharacterExplanation{shiexplanation}{ To write the letter |shi| it is
important to align three lines \textbf{vertically} (red line) and to
\textbf{non-align} the ends (blue line). In this way it is possible to
distinguish |shi| from |tsu|. Of course also the angle of the frist two lines
are different, but in hadwriting this is difficult to match. As a rule of thumb
make the third line double as long as the first two but short enough to not
align it at the end. }

\CharacterExplanation{tsuexplanation}{ To write the letter |tsu| it is
important to align all tree lines \textbf{horizontally} (red line) and to

are different, but in handwriting this is difficult to match. As a rule of
