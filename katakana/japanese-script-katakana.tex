\chapter{片仮名 - Katakana}

\Warn{Warning!}{This work is a \textbf{draft}. It is not complete and contains
errors. Please report.}

\bigskip

The second Japanese Kana script, \hyperref[sec:Syllable]{syllable}, better
\hyperref[sec:Mora]{morae} based writing system is called Katakana and written
in Japanese as {片仮名} {【かたかな】} but sometimes also as {カタカナ}.  It
consists of a littel less the 50 letters, as it is usual for morae baseed
systems and it derived from Chinese characters, called Kanji
{漢字}　{【かんじ】} in Japanese. Together they form a complete phonetic
script. 

Even though Katakana can be used by its own to express the complete content of
the Japanese language it is almost never used as such.This is due to the fact
that the other two scripts Hiragana and Kanji exists and that there was
traditionally no space character to separate words. So a Katakana sentence with
Katakana only and no spaces is hardly understandable due to many homophones.
But even if there are spaced it is difficult. Therefore the letter type
boundaries of Kanji, Hirangana and Katakana are the most significant indicator
for word boundaries. 

In the Japanese written language Katakana has a destricnt role. It serves for:

\begin{tabular}{rl}
1.& writing words of foreign origin\\
2.& words that need to be emphasized\\
3.& botanic names\\
4.& faunic names\\
5.& partly onomatopoeias in Manga\\	
\end{tabular}

\section{Pronunciation and Intonation}

The pronunciation of Katakana is the same as for Hiragana. Therefore every
syllable, more precise every mora corresponds to a Katakana character and is
constructed as 'consonant' + 'vowel' with the exception of |n|. This system of
letter for each mora makes pronunciation absolutely clear with no
ambiguities. However the simplicity of Katakana does not mean that
pronunciation in Japanese is simple for English speakers as it is for Germans. 
The rigid structure of the fixed mora sound in Japanese creates the challenge 
of learning the proper intonation and duration of Japanese pronunciation. 

Almost each Japanese word can be chunked into morae of high and low pitch witch
is a crucial aspect of the spoken language. Compared to Chinese, Japanese
luckily have only two pitched: hi and low. Sometimes this difference can be
even important for the lexic. Homophones can have for example a difference in
pitch which make them distinguishable.  The intonation of high and low pitches
is a crucial aspect of the spoken language. One of the biggest problems for
obtaining a natural sounding pronunciation is the incorrect intonation. Many
European or American learners speak without paying attention to the correct
pitch. That makes the speech sound non-natural for Japanese. In some language
course try to let the learner memorize the natural pitch of a word or even
teach rules for memorization. While there is clearly a possibility for
linguistic rules, they are hard to remember and master. Also because they can
remember the rules it is still possible to learn the correct intonation by
resorting to language learning techniques used by infants or small children:
mimicking native Japanese speakers. Therefore it is highly adviced to expose
oneself to as many Japanese spoken language as possible and to mimic it. Radio,
podcasts, drama and television to name a few. However, it is not adviced to
listen too much artificial sources like anime or commercials.  

\begin{tabular}{rl}
-&every (yes \textbf{every}) mora is pronounced with the same length\\
-&there is no short and long mora or letters\\
-&every mora has a pich: high or low\\
-&every pitch matters\\
-&the pitch can change with its context\\
-&the pitch can change with a dialect - however well defined in standard Japanese\\
\end{tabular}

\section{Writing Katakana}

Writing Katakana is not much different as writing Hiragana. Katakana is written
mostly from left to right and up to down. In some texts from up to up to down
and right to left.

Even if it possible to change the orientation the letter as such is \textbf{not} rotated.
