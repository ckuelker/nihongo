\chapter*{Introduction - 前書き}

The first chapter will introduce the Japanese writing system and different
alphabets. I you are already familiar with it, you can safely skip this
chapter. In any case all terms are explained in the last chapter.

The second chapter starts with the introduction of writing and reading single
Katakana letters. The chapter ends with special Katakana letters. It is advised
to read this chapter before starting the training. 

The third chapter goes right into action by offering row based training
sessions for each character as well as simple training for writing some
Japanese Katakana words.


The last chapter provides an alphabetically ordered glossary about the most
important key words.
