Every person is learning in a different way. What works well for one does not
need to work well also for the other. Because of this an ultimate receipt to
learn Katakana can not be given here. However the introduction to this chapter
would like to try to give some  hints gathered from learning and teaching
experience. 

\begin{description}

\item[Not too less:] If one learns one character per day, it will take for
Katakana roughly 46 days.  If you restrict this to working days it will take
approximately two month. If you restrict it to a 2h lesson per week it will
take a year to learn Katakana. It is obvious that one is likely to forget the
first characters when learning the last. However, even with this method it is
not impossible, but not likely.

\item[Not too much:]  To learn Katakana in one day is unlikely possible. At
least parts will be forgotten the next day.

\end{description}

From the practice the best results have been seen when learners have tried to
learn Katkana in one to three weeks. The suggestion is to learn one line (five
characters) per day in a cumulative way. Means, repeat every day the already
learned characters and that up to 10 days until all are learned. And then
repeat this exercise until they hardly can not be forgotten any more. So for
at least 14 consecutive days without break. 

\begin{description}

\item[Develop your own style:] Learning one character at a time or a row (five
characters at a time) or learn the whole table of Katakana is possible. With
some method it can take 3 weeks or with an other method 1 week. That does not
matter. What do matter is that oneself is comfortable with the method and that
oneself extract fun out of it, even when forced to learn Katakana. Decide by
yourself how often you repeat. But decide. And write down your decision. Maybe
even plan it in your daily plan. A good practice is to learn Katakana 20 times
a day for five minutes rather then one time for three hours a day or one time a
week for 10 hours. 

\item[Search for aid:] Aid can come in may manifestations. Of course it is
useful to ask a Japanese to help. But there are many other ways for helping
yourself.  One example are flashcards. Of course it is easy to print them in
this book. However as said before: find your own way. And if you create
flashcards by yourself you already learn the content up to a certain level. 

\item[Use Squares:] Some European languages uses lines to teach letters. In
Japanese you should use a square and draw the letter in the middle. If
uncertain about the shape and orientation of the character use a square and
look at the squares filled with Katakana in this section to understand the
alignment and orientation.

Here are some examples for flashcards. But feel free to invent your own.


\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{cc}
\textbf{front site Katakana}&\textbf{back site Romaji}\\
\includegraphics[scale=1.5]{../share/i/fcar.pdf}% Romaji - Katakana
&
\includegraphics[scale=1.5]{../share/i/fcak.pdf}% Hiragana Katakana
\\
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

Or to learn both:

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{cc}
\textbf{front site Romaji}&\textbf{back site both}\\
\includegraphics[scale=1.5]{../share/i/fcar.pdf}% Romaji - Katakana
&
\includegraphics[scale=1.5]{../share/i/fcahk.pdf}% Hiragana Katakana
\\
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

To dive deep into Japanese of course skipping Romaji is the preferred method:

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{cc}
\textbf{front site Katakana}&\textbf{back site Hiragana}\\
\includegraphics[scale=1.5]{../share/i/fcak.pdf}% Romaji - Katakana
&
\includegraphics[scale=1.5]{../share/i/fcah.pdf}% Hiragana Katakana
\\
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

This training chapter can be used as an additional aid to learn Katakana. And
also here it is important to develop ones own method. However some hints on
learning with this training chapter can be given.

\begin{description}

\item[Reading Loud:] While writing a Katakana character in this book (and
probably also later), read out loud the sound of the character. Always. 

\item[Invent your own cribs:] One can (maybe should?) invent one crib per
character by oneself. Especially if the characters is difficult to remember. It
might be useful to write it down on the self created flashcard for that
specific character.

\item[Regular Repetition:] It is of course possible to fill out all fields
for one chracter in a very short time. The learning effect should be minimal
though. Better is to fill out one row and then the second row an hour later,
the third row the next day and so own. Oneself has to decide the rhythm of
the repetition. 

\item[Transcription:]  Search for a  Katakana text and read it. Write for every
Katakana word the Roman letters. If this is possible without looking up the
Katakana, then the transcription should be reversed. Find some Japanese text
written in Romaji and transcribe them on Katakana on a different piece of
paper.
