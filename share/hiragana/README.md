The PDF files in this directory are made by inkscape v0.48 (Debian 8.11
(jessie)) from the file `hiragana.svg` by export. As the resolution of this
file depends on the desktop and inkscape application, as of now (2023-01-10) it
is recommended to use Debian GNU/Linux 8.11 (jessie) inkcape version 0.48.5-3.

As far as known the export resolution of inkscape v0.48 under Debian 8.11 is
90dpi, while the export/import resolution of inkscape v1.0.2 under Debian 11.6
(bullseye) is 96dpi. A conversion of the file from inkscape v0.48 to v1.0.2 was
not successful so far.
