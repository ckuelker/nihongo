# Directory nihongo/share/hiragana Aim

Shared Japanese resources for building a hiragana book.

# Resolution and Inkscape Version

The PDF files in this directory were created by inkscape v0.48 (Debian 8.11
(Jessie)) by exporting the file `hiragana.svg`. Since the resolution of this
file depends on the desktop and inkscape application, it is now (2023-03-07)
recommended to use Debian GNU/Linux 8.11 (Jessie) inkscape version 0.48.5-3.

As far as is known, the export resolution of inkscape v0.48 on Debian 8.11 is
90dpi, while the export/import resolution of inkscape v1.0.2 on Debian 11.6
(Bullseye) is 96dpi. Converting the file from inkscape v0.48 to v1.0.2 has not
been successful yet.

Additional information can be found the `share/katakana/README.md`.
