# Directory nihongo/share/katakana Aim

Japanese resources to share for building a Katakana book

# Name Schema for PDF Graphic Files

Most PDF graphic files in this directory are created via `katakana.svg` by
inkscape (version 0.48.5 r10040 - or similar (Debian Wheezy, Jessie). Some
other files in `nihongo/share/i` too. As the resolution of `katakana.svg`
depends on the desktop and the inkscape application (as of now 2023-01-10) it
is recommended to use Debian GNU/Linux 8.11 (jessie) to make changes to
`katakana.svg`.

As far as known the export resolution of inkscape v0.48 under Debian 8.11 is
90dpi, while the export/import resolution of inkscape v1.0.2 under Debian 11.6
(bullseye) is 96dpi. A conversion of the file from inkscape v0.48 to v1.0.2 was
not successful so far.
