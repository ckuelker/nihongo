# Directory nihongo/share/katakana Aim

Shared Japanese resources for building a katakana book.

# Resolution and Inkscape Version

Most of the PDF graphics files in this directory are created by `katakana.svg`
from inkscape (version 0.48.5 r10040 - or similar (Debian Wheezy, Jessie). Some
other files in `nihongo/share/i` as well. Since the resolution of
`katakana.svg` depends on the desktop and the inkscape application (as of
2023-01-10), it is recommended to use Debian GNU/Linux 8.11 (Jessie) to make
changes to `katakana.svg`.

As far as is known, the export resolution of inkscape v0.48 on Debian 8.11 is
90dpi, while the export/import resolution of inkscape v1.0.2 on Debian 11.6
(Bullseye) is 96dpi. Converting the file from inkscape v0.48 to v1.0.2 has not
been successful yet.
