                The original version of this book was written by
                \textbf{Christian Külker} and is copyrighted 2000-2006,
                2013-2014 under the GNU-FDL version 1.2 or any later version
                published by the Free Software Foundation with only this
                section as invariant section. \medskip

                The version v0.1 - v0.8 of this book \textbf{日本語を書こう！}
                (German: \textit{Lasst uns Japanisch schreiben!}) was developed
                as reference and training book for the language course at the
                VHS Halle (Ravensberg) in Germany starting year 2000. It was
                published 2003, 2004 and 2006 under the GNU FDL.\medskip

                In 2014 (v0.9) the part of Katakana was made a book on its own.
                The title was changed to \textbf{日本語の書き方：片仮名}
                (English: \textit{The Japanese Script - Katakana}) and adopted
                to a self study approach.\medskip

                In 2020 (v1.0) the source code was changed to compile under
                Debian 10 Buster. Some fonts have been changed in the
                appendix.\medskip
