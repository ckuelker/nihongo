At the same time as \hyperref[sec:Hiragana]{Hiragana}, also \textbf{Katakana}
letters where invented by simplifying the same Chinese characters used for
pronunciation.  However the look and feel of \textbf{Katakana} is more 'square'
not so 'rounded' as \hyperref[sec:Hiragana]{Hiragana}.

\textbf{Katakana} is used today for writing words of foreign origin and for
emphasizing (in commercials or \hyperref[sec:Manga]{Manga}) as well as word in
the fauna or flora.
