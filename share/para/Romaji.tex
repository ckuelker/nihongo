In temporary Japan words written western letters become more popular and some
parts of the written language is already westernized, like numbers written in
horizontal text almost per default.  This western letters are called
\textbf{Rōmaji} and are written in Japanese as {ローマ字} {【ろおまじ】}, even
though some of them are from different origin like Indian numbers.
