\section{Katakana Iteration Marks - ??? } \label{sec:Iteration}

As with {漢字} {【かんじ】} also {片仮名} has a iteration mark.  「ヽ」 and its
{濁点} {【だくてん】} form {「ヾ」}. This can only be
found in rare cases. For example the personal name Misuzu 【みすゞ】might
contain this character. And since the difference between the second last
and the last mora is only a change in pronunciation the {濁点} is added.

In vertical writing exist another iteration marker {くの字点} {【くのじてん】}
which consist out of two characters {「〳」+「〵」} and the {濁点} form
is {「〴」+「〵」}
