\section{Pronunciation and Intonation}\jsec{発音とイントネーション}\label{sec:PronunciationAndIntonation}

The pronunciation of Katakana is the same as for Hiragana. Therefore every
syllable, more precise every mora corresponds to a Katakana character and is
constructed as 'consonant' + 'vowel' with the exception of |n|. This system of
letter for each mora makes pronunciation absolutely clear with no ambiguities.
However the simplicity of Katakana does not mean that pronunciation in Japanese
is simple for English speakers as it is for Germans.  The rigid structure of
the fixed mora sound in Japanese creates the challenge of learning the proper
intonation and duration of Japanese pronunciation.

Almost each Japanese word can be chunked into morae of high and low pitch witch
is a crucial aspect of the spoken language. Compared to Chinese, Japanese
luckily have only two pitches: hi and low. Sometimes this difference can be
even important for the lexis. Homophones can have for example a difference in
pitch which make them distinguishable.  The intonation of high and low pitches
is a crucial aspect of the spoken language. One of the biggest problems for
obtaining a natural sounding pronunciation is the incorrect intonation. Many
European or American learners speak without paying attention to the correct
pitch. That makes the speech sound non-natural for Japanese. In some language
course try to let the learner memorize the natural pitch of a word or even
teach rules for memorization. While there is clearly a possibility for
linguistic rules, they are hard to remember and master. Also because they can
remember the rules it is still possible to learn the correct intonation by
resorting to language learning techniques used by infants or small children:
mimicking native Japanese speakers. Therefore it is highly advised to expose
oneself to as many Japanese spoken language as possible and to mimic it. Radio,
podcasts, drama and television to name a few. However, it is not advised to
listen too much artificial sources like anime or commercials.

The pronunciation of Katakana is exactly the same as for Hiragana and most
sounds are very close to the Latin pronunciation but in general are pronounced a
little shorter without any stress. Only the /ra/ sounds, like in /ra/, /ri/, /ru/,
/re/ and /ro/ have no similarity in European languages.
