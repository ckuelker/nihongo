\section{Special Katakana Characters - 特別カタカナ}\label{sec:SpecialKatakanaCharacters}

As mentioned before Katakana is almost like Hiragana. This is true for the
\hyperref[sec:50SoundTable]{50 sound table  {五十音図} {【ごじゅうおんず】}}
This section will show the special characters, some are different from the
Hiragana set.

Special in some sense are characters used for punctuation, like {「。」},
{「！」} and {「？」}.  These are similar to the western counterparts but
differ a little bit. While it is obvious for the small circle {「。」}, also
{「！」} and {「？」} differ from the western equivalent in that sense that
they are \textbf{centerd} and occupy more (white) space. This characters among
other characters are used equally among Hiragana, Katakana and Kanji. Therefore
this section will not further mention them.

Special Katakana characters do also exists. The most important character is
the plain iteration character {「ー」}, written as a stroke. It is one of the
very few which changes orientation according the writing orientation. When
writing Katakana from left to right the iteration character is horizontal,
while writing Katakana from up to down it is vertical. The function of
this character is to double the previous mora. This is also different
from Hiragana.

\CharacterExplanation{k-iteration-s}{In standard gothic fonts the Katakana
iteration character is just a straight line and it is not possible to
understand in which direction it has to written. }

\bigskip

\CharacterExplanation{k-iteration-sm}{However if it is written with a different
font or with a brush it is clearly visible that in horizontal writing it is
written from left to right.}

\textit{Example:}

\bigskip

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{ll}
Katakana:&Hiragana:\\
\Huge カ\textbf{\color{magenta}ー}ド /kaado/ &\Huge か\textbf{\color{magenta}あ}ど /kaado/\\
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

This character is very often used and makes Katakana for this easier then
Hiragana. The long vowel ambiguity do not exist.

As mentioned above the orientation of the Katakana iteration character changes
with the direction of writing. The above example with different writing
orientation.

% めったに使われない片仮名 【めったにつかわれないかたかな】

Even though |wo| {「ヲ」}  is part if the standard letters. But since all
particle are written in Hiragana and in this case |wo| is written {「を」} the
learning of {「ヲ」} can be skipped. Unless it is important to read old texts,
like telegrams.
