\section{音節 - Syllables} \label{sec:Syllable}

A syllable {音節}  {【おんせつ】}  is a phonetic building block for words. It
influences the rhythm of a spoken language. In western language a syllable is
made out of one or more letters. In Japanese it is often one character, but not
always. For a better understanding of the Japanese it is important to
understand the concept of \hyperref[sec:Mora]{mora}.
