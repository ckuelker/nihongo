\section{Writing Katakana Letters - 片仮名を一つづつ書く} \label{sec:WritingKatakanaLetters}

Writing Katakana words start with writing single Katakana letters. Knowing the
writing and reading of Katakana letters is essential to pronounce foreign words
in Japanese correctly. And that is even more important for learners who have
good English knowledge, because it is very tempting to pronounce English words
in Japanese with original English pronunciation, which is seldom
understood\footnote{The reader might try to order a cheeseburger at a fast food
restaurant insted of a /chiizubaagaa/ (チーズバーガー).} by Japanese people
who are used to their Japanese-English pronunciation. 

By learning Katakana the understanding of morae and syllables will also 
help to improve the pronunciation and understanding of Japanese. 

Katakana as most letters are a joint combination of strokes. For the writing of Katakana
some rules are important, which are presented here out of order.


\begin{description}

\item[Order:] The order of strokes is important. In section
\ref{sec:StrokeOrderMatter} on page \pageref{sec:StrokeOrderMatter} more can be found. 

\item[Fasted Method of Writing:] Often the fastest possible method of writing
or order of strokes is the correct one.  Often from left upper corner to right
lower corner. But exceptions do exist.

\item[The characters (letters) are \textit{not} symmetric.]

\item[All characters (letters) occupy a square.]

\item[The aesthetic:] What make the character to a beautiful character? The
answer is different for each character.

Following some possibilities of rule generation for the character ``u''
 {「ウ」 }:

\bigskip \CharacterExplanation{u-guide2}{The most important feature is that the
second and third line do not align. This is not an accident.}

\bigskip \CharacterExplanation{u-guide0}{Except many Hiragana for some Katakana
the base line is aligned with horizon. As with this character. }


\bigskip \CharacterExplanation{u-guide1}{Also the start (or turning) points of
all other lines are aligned vertically. Which gives this Katakana its unique
square look.}


\bigskip \CharacterExplanation{u-guide}{All together some lines need to be
remembered to write the letter beautiful.}

\bigskip

\item[A different logic:] A little bit less the Hiragana, but also in Katakana
there are some lines that do not align horizontally  or vertically. Or to say
it differently some characters are not stright on purpose.

\end{description}

On top of this the following is most likely valid: Only if one can write a
letter it is (easier) possible to faster learn and memorize it.

\subsection{Stroke Order Matter!}\label{sec:StrokeOrderMatter}

Some European individualists might ask them self \textit{"Why do I have to
remember the order of strokes - I don't obay this in my language - and who
defined this in the first place (if not me)?"} and this seems obvious in
Europe. However some reason for order exist. 

\begin{description}

\item[1. Impression:] It make a unprofessional impression to Japanese, if one
writes characters in the wrong order. Some laughs can be observed at least.

\item[2. Tests:]  In some tests/ exams (in Japan) the order of strokes will be
tested and one got 0 points for the wrong order. 

\item[3. Time Savings:] In the most cases the predefined order is the fastest
way to write a character. Overall once save (life) time.

\item[4. Readability:] In some cases characters become readable only (or
beautiful) of the order is correct.

\item[5. Confusion Danger:] For only some characters the order is utmost
important. If not obeyed it is very likely (almost certain) that this
characters become a candidate for a wrong interpretation.

\subsection{Example /u/ {「ウ」}}

The Katakana /u/ is written as {「ウ」} in Japanese. The character is composed
out of the following three components:

\bigskip 
\CharacterExplanation{uds1}{This is stroke 1}
\bigskip 
\CharacterExplanation{uds2}{This is stroke 2}
\bigskip 
\CharacterExplanation{uds3}{This is stroke 3} 

Of course the strokes need to be at the right place. So better always think or draw 
a frame aound. Or even better write the strokes into a frame from the beginning!

\bigskip 
\CharacterExplanation{udss1}{This is stroke 1 in a square frame}
\bigskip 
\CharacterExplanation{udss2}{This is stroke 2 in a square frame}
\bigskip 
\CharacterExplanation{udss3}{This is stroke 3 in a square frame} 


%\begin{center}
%\textbf{Stroke 1:} \includegraphics[trim= 00 15 00 00]{../share/katakana/uds1.pdf}
%\textbf{Stroke 2:} \includegraphics[trim= 00 15 00 00]{../share/katakana/uds2.pdf}
%\textbf{Stroke 3:} \includegraphics[trim= 00 15 00 00]{../share/katakana/uds3.pdf}
%\end{center}
\bigskip

This components have to be written in the above mentioned enumeration order one
after another. (The first example is without frame)

\bigskip 
\CharacterExplanation{udg1}{This is stroke 1 in context}
\bigskip 
\CharacterExplanation{udg2}{This is stroke 2 in context}
\bigskip 
\CharacterExplanation{udg3}{This is stroke 3 in context}

%\begin{center}
%\textbf{Stroke 1:} \includegraphics[trim= 00 15 00 00]{../share/katakana/udg1.pdf}
%
%\textbf{Stroke 2:} \includegraphics[trim= 00 15 00 00]{../share/katakana/udg2.pdf}
%
%\textbf{Stroke 3:} \includegraphics[trim= 00 15 00 00]{../share/katakana/udg3.pdf}
%\end{center}

\bigskip 
\CharacterExplanation{udgs1}{This is stroke 1 in context in a square frame}
\bigskip 
\CharacterExplanation{udgs2}{This is stroke 2 in context in a square frame}
\bigskip 
\CharacterExplanation{udgs3}{This is stroke 3 in context in a square frame}

\bigskip

In the Katakana training section in this document the order will be introduced
as red numbers and arrows which give the approximate direction where to place
the writing device. 

%\begin{center}
% \includegraphics[trim= 00 05 00 00]{../share/katakana/us.pdf}
%\end{center}
\bigskip

\CharacterExplanation{us}{Write the first short strokes straight from up to
down. Then - and this is difficult place the second stroke in the correct
distance from the first one. Luckily this is also a straight stroke from up to
down. }

\bigskip

Of course the perception changes if the character is written in a square.
Remember that it is better to write the character in a square, because the
correct spaces between the character and the frame also determinates its
beauty.

\bigskip

\CharacterExplanation{uss}{The first stroke in the frame is not difficult as
mentioned before from straight up to down. However the frame helps because now
we understood that it is centered. The second stroke become also easier in a
frame because it is written at the edge of the character. After some time and
experience this is better understood. The last stroke has to join the first and
second stroke. That is still difficult with or without a frame.}

\subsection{Stroke Shapes}

In European language there is no idea to have different stroke types unless one
enter the field of calligraphy. In Japanese there are different kind of
strokes.  Most important for Kanji, second important for Hiragana and least
important for Katakana since Katakana is also used for a bold replacement.  Due
to this fact the five different shapes of Japanese strokes will not repeated
here. For now it is perfectly fine to make all strokes equally thick.
